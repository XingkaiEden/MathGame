//what I learned from this code project:
//1. Don't call functions inside "setInterval" and "setTimeout", just write the funtions inside the brackets
//2. I can't put startButton and CounterBox in a same line althrough I had tried lots of methods. Finally, I found out that a sigle<div> can be used to include these two elements and the Problem Sovled!

//3. Found a problem that array did not change for every run, therefore the correct answer is always at the same postion.


//critical point:
//1. how to randome put answer in boxes
